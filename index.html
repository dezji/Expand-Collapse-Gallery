                    <i>
                        <p>
                            The first way to include the jQuery library in a web page is to after downloading jQuery from the jQuery download page 
                            then, link it in the code using the script element and the src attribute.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another way to include the jQuery library in a web page is to get the file from a CDN and link it using the script element 
                            and the src attribute. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The val() method can both get and set the value in a given text box / control in a form.</p>
                        <p>The text() method can also get and set but the difference is that it deals with the text of a given element in a form.</p>
                        <p>The next() method can get the next sibling of a given element or type in a form; but the type has to be included in the parentheses as a parameter.</p>
                        <p>The submit() method is the same as a JS submit in that it can submit the given form.</p>
                        <p>The focus() method is also similar to its JS counterpart; it moves the focus to a given control in a form.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The prev() method can get the previous sibling of the given element or a sibling of a given type.</p>
                        <p>The find() method can search through the given element and output its descended elements.</p>
                        <p>
                            The attr() method can get and set the value of the given parameter's attribute but it only 
                            gets the value from the first selected element while setting the value can be for each selected element.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The css() method can get and set the value of a propert but it can only get the first selected element's property 
                            and it can set the value for each selected element's property.
                        </p>
                        <p>The addClass() method can add classes to the selected elements and if the class doesn't exist, it creates the class.</p>
                        <p>The removeClass() method just removes the classes specified in the argument.</p>
                        <p>The toggleClass() method can add a class to the selected element and remove a class if the selected element has one.</p>
                        <p>The html() method can set the HTML contents of the selected element to whatever the argument presented is.</p>
                        <p>
                            The hide() method just hides the selected elements. A duration can be entered (optionally) as a parameter to determine how long 
                            the element is hidden for.
                        </p>
                        <p>The show() method is just like the hide() method excepts it shows the selected elements, and the duration (optional) can be set.</p>
                        <p>The each() method can call a function for each element in an selected element's array.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The ready() event method is just like the window.onload event, but it runs when the DOM is ready, so it is faster than its 
                            JavaScript counterpart.
                        </p>
                        <p>The click() event method is just like the JavaScript onclick event in that it runs the function when the element is clicked.</p>
                        <p>The mouseover() event method runs its function when the mouse moves over the element in question.</p>
                        <p>The hover() event method runs when the mouse into a given element and when the mouse moves out of said given element.</p>
